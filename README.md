SmolAgent PDF is a lightweight AI agent that enables natural language interaction with PDF documents using local language models. The project integrates the Smolagents framework with tools for PDF parsing, embedding, and retrieval, allowing users to query documents conversationally without relying on external APIs. It demonstrates skills in agent design, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and working with local LLMs, making it efficient, private, and adaptable for document analysis tasks.
This is the simple example of using smolagent agent to chat with PDF. 
Smolagent can work with only three components: a) codeagent and b) moodel and c) tools.
In this examplae local model is being used which is well supported by LiteLLm.
